Influential Person Website
Brief Description: I made a website base on Tyler, The Creator because he inspires and influences me.

Peer Review:
I like the use of a gif for the header for the first page. The design is nice, with a good blend of colors. You don’t need a footer but a footer with links to Tyler’s socials might fill in some space at the bottom. On the Home page, at 1920 by 1080 resolution, the albums have a large space in between them, I feel like it would be good to shrink it a little. The Why page could use a header as well to keep it in line with the Home, though it can be an image. As of now the favorites and gallery page are empty. For your script link at the bottom of your body in your HTML pages, the triple period is unnecessary (…/). The mobile pages for the two you have done are very nice, no criticisms there.

Github not working for some reason, need help from TA, putting this here for a just in case Aidan forgets.
